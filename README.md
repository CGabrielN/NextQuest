# NextQuest
Desktop app developed as a server-client desktop app with the backend developed in Java using Spring Boot that has access to a PostGreSQL database, and a client that is developed using the Electron framework.

This app's role is to assist our users in defining a path for their education by using custom roadmaps made by experts in that domain, companies that want to train current or possible future employees or made by our AI model based on the knowledge of the user.

This app was started during the Polihack 2024 hackathon with a team of 4.

## Features

- Users(normal or company employees) can create roadmaps for other users to use/buy.
- Users can view a map, go through it's content and take quizez assigned to each step.


## Desired Features

- Statistics and feedback for tests
- Expansion of quiz types (integrated compilers for IT problems and others)
- AI integration for roadmaps suggestions and better help

## Tech stack

**Frontend:** HTMl, CSS, JavaScript, Electron, Tailwind, Bootstrap

**Backend:** Java, SpringBoot

**Database:** PostgreSQL
